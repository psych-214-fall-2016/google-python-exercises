Google Python class exercises, Python 3
#######################################

These are a slightly modified version of the exercises from Google's Python
class: https://developers.google.com/edu/python/

The modifications are to make the exercises run correctly on Python 3.

I (Matthew Brett) did the Python 3 port by simple application of the future
library:

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/future

I did some small edits to the changes to remove un-needed imports.

Otherwise, these files are as from the Google Python class website, downloaded
from https://developers.google.com/edu/python/google-python-exercises.zip on
August 30, 2016.
